On the way down one of my friends broke there ankle.

## Hotel
We got to a much fancier hotel and all got cleaned up and went to a celebration
dinner. I tought the bartender how to make a [gimlet]() and procceded to have 10
throughout the night. We had a ton of fun catching up with the photographers.

## Safari
The next day we went to the Safari

## Day in the Market
We started this day going to get some cash from the bank which also conveinetly had
a coffee shop in it. I naturally ordered and amirllo espresso. The bank took
much longer than I expected to get cash as I had to wait behind some guys who
had to have their masive stacks of cash counted (1:2500ish exchange rate).

Proceeded to buy more art. I met one of the guys who sold me art the first day while buying the 
last beer at the restaurant. I then asked him if I could try the food all the
shop keepers where eating (I way over paid for my beer).

## Ariving at the airport

What we thought would be our journey home was really just the begining. 

Met a Dutch family who biked around Kili.

In the lounge, the worker their made me feel guilty about matching with gals in Arusha and not following up with them.
After sitting in a lounge chair for awhile I ran into Josh, I mentioned that I had a
nine hour lay over in Amsterdam and he mentinoed I could definitly spend some time
out in the city.

Between all this was this Crazy lady who opened all kinds of centers to help the Musai tribe.

## JRO (Arusha, Tanzania) to DAR

Our flight from JRO to DAR was uneventfull. The plain at DAR was to quickly pick up
some aditional passangers on our way to Amsterdam. We where then infomred that one 
of the wings was leaking hydrolic fluid and we would all have to disembark from 
the plan.

Getting of the plan took forever because of customs or something. During this
time I decided to sit in an open business class seat which was quite nice.

Getting off the plain though was when panic started to set in for our group who
where all anxiously waiting to get back to our lives.

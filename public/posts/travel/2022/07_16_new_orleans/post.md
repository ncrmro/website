## Background - Friday

At the coffee shop with Andy and we're talking about some relationship drama.
Andy tells me he's wanting to visit Chicago or OTHER_PLACE. We then set up the
trip and decide to leave early Saturday morning which actually turned into
leaving after lunch at Godivas

## Saturday Getting Into New Orleans

- French Quarter/Jackson Square
- CC's Coffee
- Argentina Gals
- Hookah Hayfa - Wanted to go to Kintered
- Walk along the river
- Bar / Talked with Chef guy

After our lunch to Godivas, a stop in Lake Charles an uneventful rest of the
drive we get to our AirBnB. Which was a bit far from the main parts we would
like to have visited but we very afordable and had some super sweet dogs.

After unloading and changing into nicer clothes we went to Carmon. We had a
vegan flatbread sort of pizza, a cold gozpatcho, I had some pork on plantains.
We had some cocktails.

After the meal we ended up talking with the bartender (who I found very pretty)
and two of the other waitress. The bartender had just moved from portland and
one of the other waitress was from Turkey!

I joked had the Porlaninan already made questionable deciosinos in Heras and the
Turkesh lady laughed and told us how she was super up and then lost a ton of
money.

We enjoyed our jib on the way back to the car and did a bit of driving to get to
the Always Lounge which we couldn't get into because we where missing one of our
wallets.

## Sunday

initially we had plan to keep driving but quickly realized we had a ton of stuff
left to see and booked another day

Sunday we started the day of at Itals Garden which was proper vegan soul food. I
think we orderd just about everything on the menu.

- Cajun Pasta
- Quona Jumbala
- Gumbo
- Fried Cauliflower
- Golden Potatoes
- Jackfruit Ribs

After this great lunch we where on the hunt for coffee and a place to work. CC's
coffee down Royal street is where we had originally planed to visit.

I mentioned we had to do a bit of walking around the French Quarter.

It quickly got to hot as we where both wearing jeans and button ups (which I
suggested against but became important later).

We proceded to try and sit aorund jackn square but all the places where more
resturants, this is when our original plan of CC's started to sound real nice.

While in CC's I offered a dad mentiong his phone was dead while his daugter used
the bathroom. This is when two beutifil ladys walked in and sat at the same
table as I.

Eventually I stuck up a conversation with them by asking had they already done
all the touristy things? Turns out they are both from Argentina and met through
an agency the places young women with familys in need of live in help.

We off an on chat with them when three more women walk up to the table and
stripe up a coversation (and again also offering charging).

We ask about Hookah places and they suggest Hayfas Hookah. We all decied to go,
we get a bucket of beer, snacks and have some hook.

We then ask if they smoke and then go to the lake Ponchier with them. We walk
along the river and admire the many pepple fishing, baby ducks, throw a fish
back in the water and even had andy show us how to dance Salsa to one of the
fishers boombox's.

Afterwords we go to a bar near their hostel and they split and I notice a guy
with chef knifes.

## Monday - Garden District

Once again we decide to stay in New Orlean and do some work. THe local ladies
recomended the Vintage for Beignets which is in the lovelly garden district. We
got a traditinal and a rasberry filled one which was amazing.

I ordered a cucumber dil gimlet and Ahi tuna.

Then we had to get a Po Boy for Andy and Killer Poboys had three vegan options.

After which we found a coffe shop in what I guess was the Irish part of New
orleans. This palce also serverd as a musueme for the Irish. We started with
coffee but avoided irish coffe cause I'm not a big fan of the cream. I'd rather
jsut drink whisky in my coffee.

I chatted with the bartender and wanted to try a reasonable whisky. My friend
chuck said he wanted to try red breast but they only had 123 and 173 a glass.

Instead he recommended a Prowlers, Pot still, no fancy barrleys and a guiness.
Which was a pairing they would be drinking 150 years ago in ireland. I spoke a
bit about my mexican Irish heritage

While I was waiting for him to finish I went and ordered a double well whisky at
the three legged dog a much seedier local bar that had quite the cast of
characters in it.

All wee we had been trying to try the Sneaky Pickle and finally got to try it.
We talked to two ladies sitting next to us who where in fro seatle for one of
their weedings.

We orderd Trumpt Mushrooms on grits, rueben which had red cabage. The ladys next
door left a whole half sandwhich which we grabbed and ate without shame.

- Beignets
- Gimlet Tuna
- Killer Po Boy
- Irish Coffee SHop
- Sneaky Pickle
    - Seatle Girls
    - Ate their food, they where behind us.

## Tuesday - Leaving

- Waffle house

Tuesday I started the morning and walked to Waffle House .7 miles away since
Andy was not much of a breakfast person.

Then we worked at Oak bread.

Shangia Thai Lunch, Garlic Softshell Crab and pad la.

We then worked at the old road coffee shop where I met mark who was also from
houston and was at eacher. He wrote two books which I skimmed and where quite
poetic. He mentioned two art shoes which where also going to be giving away bags
full of art supplies to youth who needed the mthe most.

After this it was decided we would head back home today

Had dinner in this place Lousianin/Mexican reasturant called Mestizo. Anonda and
I ordered some guac which had grilled peaches and feta. A few ordd combo but was
pretty tasty.

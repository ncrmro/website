## Journey to Arush

Pretty unevent, made a few friends in the air port lounge. Got pretty lit at the

climbing kili with them but since I wasn't wearing any Valley Wise Health gear

When we arrived in arush and got out of customs we had about an hour loading 
the busses and making friends. This is where I met Brandon my soon to be roomie
and Stacy.

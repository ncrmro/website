## Overview

I'm writing this about two weeks from the trip to Tanzania to climb/hike
Kilimanjaro. I'm going with Courage Rising a partnership
between [Valleywise Health Foundation](http://valleywisehealthfoundation.org)
and [K2 adventures](https://k2adventuretravel.com) as a part of a group
consisting of burn survivors, health professionals, and donors. We are raising
money for the Arizona Burn Center, I need to raise an additional 7.5k to meet my
goal. Donations can be
made [here](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/valleywise-health-foundation/courage-rising/nicholas-romero-2)

## How I got involved

My friend and coworker [Juan Palomino](https://twitter.com/JuanForTheMoney)
invited me. He set up setting up an NFT drop
called [Viva Muerto](https://www.vivamuertos.com) to raise money for Valley
Health. Our friend and his girlfriend Mikala works at Valleywise Health and has
been help run and organize the trip.

## Raising Money

The goal for each of the team members is to raise 10,000$ USD. This money goes
to the foundation and K2 then has donated their guided tour, as of writing.

Fundraising is hard I've learned, it's not easy to push politely, with friends
and family and any donations should be met with gratitude. Previously it was
(verbally) mentioned that we could raise what we could and call it a day.

With a large amount of hubris during the on boarding call said I would cover
what remained after my fundraising attempts. An email was sent out later
mentioning anyone who doesn't meet their goal won't be able to attend, and
further correspondence mentioned that we could (again) donate the rest
ourselves (for a nice tax write-off).

## Expenses (Gear & Travel)

The fundraiser does not include the travel or gear costs. The K2 team
provided [a gear list](http://valleywisehealthfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/20â€¦)
Although after a bit of research and discussion this gear list is slightly
superfluous, eg multiple types of boots.

The flight to Tanzania on KLM is about 2000$ itself. And I've spent around 1000
dollars on gear. Some of which I'm hoping to use in the future. Currently, I've
gotten my last haul of shipments and trying to open all the boxes.

## Physical Fitness and Altitude

I'm pretty strong (dead lifted 450x5 today) although I could do a bit more
cardio and I wish I had gotten to do more altitude training. I did some reading
though on the world record holders and Kili has been (with acclimation and not
carrying food) summited in 6 hours, also they say 5 day summits a ton of people
don't finish and 9 are pretty easy so our 7 day shouldn't be so bad.

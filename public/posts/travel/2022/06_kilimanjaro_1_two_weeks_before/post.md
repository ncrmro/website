I'm writing this 13 days out from my trip to Tanzania to climb/hike Kilimanjaro.
I'm going with Courage Rising a partnership
between [Valleywise Health Foundation](http://valleywisehealthfoundation.org)
and [K2 adventures](https://k2adventuretravel.com) as a part of a group
consisting of burn survivors, health professionals, and donors. We are raising
money for the Arizona Burn Center.

## How I got involved

My friend and coworker [Juan Palomino](https://twitter.com/JuanForTheMoney)
invited me. He set up setting up an NFT drop
called [Viva Muerto](https://www.vivamuertos.com) to raise money for Valley
Health.

## Raising Money

One way or the other I need to raise 10,000$ USD for the foundation. This goes
to the foundation and K2 then has donated their guided tour, as of writing I'm
at 2832$.

I'm not going to lie fundraising is hard as it's not easy to push for politely,
especially with friends and family. Previously it was (verbally)
mentioned that we could raise what we could and call it a day.

I of course with a large amount of hubris said I would cover whatever I couldn't
raise and it wouldn't be an issue. An email was sent out later mentioning anyone
who doesn't meet their goal won't be able to attend, and further correspondence
mentioned that we could (again) donate the rest ourselves (for a nice tax
write-off).

Of course, I had a much larger tax bill than anticipated

## Other Expenses (Gear & Travel)

Naturally, the fundraiser does not include the travel or gear costs. The K2 team
provided [a gear list](http://valleywisehealthfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/20â€¦)
Although after a bit of research and discussion this gear list is slightly
superfluous, eg multiple types of boots.

The flight to Tanzania on KLM is about 2000$ itself. And I've spent around 1000
dollars on gear. Some of which I'm hoping to use in the future. Currently, I've
gotten my last haul of shipments and trying to open all the boxes.

## Physical Fitness and Altitude

I'm pretty strong (dead lifted 450x5 today) although I could do a bit more
cardio and I wish I had gotten to do more altitude training. I did some reading
though on the world record holders and Kili has been (with acclimation and not
carrying food) sumited in 6 hours, also they say 5 day summits a ton of people don't finish
and 9 are pretty easy so our 7 day shouldn't be so bad.

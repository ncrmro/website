I've been contemplating
the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect)
.

This idea boils down to the fact that I'm knowledgeable in a very few specific
niches
and in many other silos prob not the best.

Furthermore, I think the more we loathe something the more likely we are to
overestimate
our ability and thus show more carelessness to that specific topic.

For instance, I bought a house for all the typical reasons but also as an
investment. Later though I learned that I prefer a digital nomad lifestyle. And
thus this
investment has turned out a be a bit of a headache. I'm not a great home seller,
more
because I loath the home and thus want to think about it as little as possible.

Or in a common case engineers love to build a startup but may not know they should
be validating it first and building it's brand.

## An Analogy

An analogy for the feeling I was having while contemplating the Dunning Kurgger
the effect is as follows.

Every person gets a view of the same stage but we are
all viewing the performance with different lights on and off.

Thus each person has a specific view of a situation such as business or
interpersonal relationships etc.

The anxiety I felt though is as successful as I've been, I've allowed myself to
drift from
my main goals (Successful Business/Financial Freedom/Art) which I now realize
maybe because I lack the knowledge and insight to
make these dreams and goals a success (although things like chance still play
into this).

### A solution in our analogy

The goal here would be increasing you're IQ/EQ/Knowledge resulting in more
illuminated lights on stage, we could also think about each light or field of
thought/knowledge
to be brighter the higher percentile performer you are but never quite covering
lesser lights.

## On increasing the stage lights.

Now this contemplation in me lead to a bit of anxiety. Figuring out

### Short Form Read and Writing

I'd have to say short-form learning through reading or media consumption (think
Twitter or TikTok)
does not lead to critical thought and is more passive consumption or
regurgitation of ideas.

### Long-Form Reading

One activity successful people have is reading. Getting into this mindset
allows our brain to slow down and digest complex ideas
in a way that doom scrolling and manic switching between social media apps
doesn't allow for.

### Long-Form Writing

Lastly, I think communication of ideas in the modern world such as tweets,
Facebook posts, Instagram stories/posts and TikTok, etc do not serve in illuminating
our stage.

Each idea is condensed to its most myopic form and then thrown
into a blender for our consumption leading us to bounce between echo chamber rooms
of thought without ever forming any novel ideas.

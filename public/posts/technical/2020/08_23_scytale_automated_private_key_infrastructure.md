## Background

While building my own infrastructure/intranet I started wanting to have SSL/TLS
connections. Almost all of my connections currently take place over Wireguard
anyway. This is handled by a project called Mercury that I still need to
opensource.

Now I have a couple VM's at the moment that host various docker containers.
While they all sit inside the Wireguard network some connections I would prefer
to happen without leaving the LAN. All of the hosts are VM's on the same NAS
that creates the NFS shares that the Docker hosts create their volumes from. But
only one of the Docker hosts contains the stateful applications, eg Postgres,
Docker Registry, RabitMQ, Prometheus.

This is where the SSL comes in we want our services to talk to Postgres/RabitMQ
etc over SSL/TLS. Additionally we can require any clients to also present a
certificate for authentication.

## PKI Basics

Both the server and client certificates are signed by our Root CA. The Root CA
certificate is installed on both the client and server thus they can each
validate each other against the Root CA. More of this is covered in the
project's readme.

## Getting Started

Some setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ncrmro/scytale.git

cd scytale

pip install ansible==2.9.10

# If you already have an Ansible Vault Key set its path in vars.yml otherwise
echo random_password > ~/.ansible/vault/default_key.txt
```

To run the ansible play just run

```bash
sh ./main.sh
```

This calls

```bash
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file ~/.ansible/vault/default_key.txt -i hosts main.yml
```

Whoot! now you have your private key infrastructure.

If you check your `vars_vault.yml` it now contains all your private keys which
can be checked into your git repo!

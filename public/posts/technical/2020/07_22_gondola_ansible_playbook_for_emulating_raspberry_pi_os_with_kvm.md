Recently I was working a project that is deployed on a raspberry pi zero. This
became problematic with trying to build stuff on the zero.

It's pretty simple, check the repo out. Install ansible and the rest of the pip
requirements.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run `sh main.sh` this will take a few minutes.

After running the Ansible play you'll have a PI that you can clone, revert etc.

The project is available [here](https://github.com/ncrmro/gondola).

## Some updates jul 29 2020

Some limitations is its single threaded and limited to 256mb of ram and I
haven't had enough time to investigate.

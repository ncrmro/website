# Why

I recently got my fourth DEXA scan over at [Live Lean RX](http://liveleanrx.com)
and the technician coaches me on nutrition and other aspects of living lean.

One thing he always mentions is training for [Vo2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max). This increasing your
[Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)](https://blog.nasm.org/nutrition/resting-metabolic-rate-how-to-calculate-and-improve-yours) aka your metabolism completely at rest.

The RMR test has you fast and then exhale into a tube for a few minutes and
checks the levels of the gases in your breath the Vo2 max test is the same but
with you working out super hard.

# How

Raising our Vo2 Max levels involves us getting our Heart to maximum BPM just for
a few seconds just like lifting heavier and heavier weights just for a bit will
make you stronger.

In [Watch OS 9](https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-9/) Apple introduced the
[heart rate zones screen](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/view-heart-rate-zones-apd30fa26bb4/watchos)
in the Workout app.

This allows us to get a visual indication of when we hit the sought-after red
zone.

# What

I decided to use a rower to get a full-body workout, it took a bit longer than I
expected and I pushed the rower to max resistance but lowered it after I started
to get gassed.

Standing up after the workout I was super shakey and for the rest of the day had
a runner's high.

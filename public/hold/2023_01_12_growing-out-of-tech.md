I remember in High School I knew I wanted to be an entraprauner. A few years later
I got paid to build a client a site and grasped at straws until I got it done.


Then I finally had an idea I was passionate about executing but cash strapped I 
thought it would be better to learn to build it myself and if that didn't work I 
could be a job as a software developer.

This lead me to opensource my tech stack to allow for experimentation and also
basically marketing my self as developer.

...

After calling finally circling back to building my core MVP and doing customer feedback
(far to late) I decided that JTX was a great "science fair project" that was complete
but decided it warented no futher investment.

During this time I was extremly blessed in my job with a steady two and half years making 
amazing money for a collage drop out. Not only that I travled, climbing Kilimanjaro with Valleywise Health, visiting Mexico and Colombia. Dated women in multiple countries.


While 2022 was great the echonomly was steadly nose diving, and right at the end of the year
this contract that I found myself so blssed by eventaully had to come to an end.

Hitting the job market you realize the gradient of different developers, some want the exact techincal terms.

...

At this point my Twitter feed was a oil splill of tech and startup advice in an
ever coalsing echo chamber. I read about tech on Hackernews. My hobbies involved
building stuff with tech, the confrences and friends I made where in tech.

Worse my other hobbies had atrophed and without purpose of a startup one realizes
maybe they arent that intresting once conversations start revolving around material posestions and work. 

Furthermore any social circle one becomes out of touch with. And any endevor weather its a startup, selling art, DJ/Music you need a socail circle outside of close friends and family.
